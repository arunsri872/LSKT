              traditionally sang in temples as offerings to our Lord. Calming to
              hear and emotionally mesmerising to sing, Pannisai is taught by
              the best in the UK for everyone and for free.

          learn all types of Tamil hymns such as thevaram, thirupuranam,
          thiruvasakam and much more. Classes are done inside the temple to
          learn in front of the Lord. There are lots of opportunities to perform
          such as singing during festivals held at the temple and other temples
          around the UK. You can also choose to take part in competitions such
          as the one held by the Federation of Saiva (Hindu) Temples UK. Before
          school begins, all Hindu students are also encouraged to take part in
          a prayer where Siva Puranam is lead by the Othuvar Moorthy.<br /><br /><br />IF
